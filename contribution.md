# Contribution

## Starting the application

1. Checkout `dev`.
2. Run `npm install` in the `frontend` and `backend` directories.
3. Run `npm run build` in the `frontend` directory.
4. Run `npm start` in the `backend` directory.
5. You can now access the application via `localhost:3000`.

## Development

If you make changes in the frontend while running the application via `localhost:3000`, you need to build the frontend again and restart the application in the `backend` directory.  
If you are just trying to style the frontend without need for the backend, run `npm start` in the `frontend` directory.  
You can now access the `frontend` via `localhost:4200`.
